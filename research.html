      <h2>Research at Meta (Reality Labs – VR)</h2>
      <p>At Meta, I led and collaborated on research within the VR space, examining how immersive environments shape user identity, presence, and emotional experience. My work included in-depth user studies, diary studies, and co-creative sessions to inform the design of social and embodied VR experiences. Key themes included digital selfhood, presence, and the ethics of identity design in virtual spaces.</p>

Our focus was on accessibility, user trust, and meaningful engagement with digital products.
